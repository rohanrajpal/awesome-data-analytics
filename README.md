# awesome-data-analytics

I have been coming across a ton of engineering challenges in my social media research and am pretty sure some challenges are common for everyone. I am creating a repo on Github with links to relevant blogs or code snippets on how I solved the problems.

**Pull requests and feedback is welcome!**

Some things I plan to add to it by the end of next week
- a python script which given some keywords, a start and end date, will scrape all tweets that have that keyword
- a python script to find duplicate images by hashing
- collection of good resources to detect language of an input string
- some tricks and tip to help in reverse engineering apis with mitmproxy
- how random exponential backoff helps in collecting data
- ~~parallelize any for loop with a cool progress bar XD~~
- doing relational queries with elasticsearch
- parallelly iterate elasticsearch in python
- elasticsearch db to csv via logstash
- fuzzy text matching at scale
